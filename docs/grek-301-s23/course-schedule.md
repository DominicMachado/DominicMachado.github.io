# Schedule - GREK 301 - S23

***

This schedule links  to the notes and charts that you'll need throughout the semester. Your homework assignment for almost every class period is to read the notes and charts sections in advance of the class meeting; then, review those concepts again after the class meeting. Use the practice opportunities throughout the notes to improve your skills.
