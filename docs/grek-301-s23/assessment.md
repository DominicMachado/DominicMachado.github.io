## Grammatical Commentary (150 points; due February )
&nbsp;  
This project will ask you to develop a grammatical commentary on a short passage from Book 8 of Herodotus in which the historian speaks about what it means to be Greek. 

You will comment on any relevant grammatical constructions, morphological oddities, or lexicographical difficulties that you feel would be helpful to students who are looking at this for the first time. In addition, you will also provide your own translation of this passage.

Further details on the grammatical commentary  assignment can be found [here](link).

## Race and Ethnicity Commentary (200 points; due March )
&nbsp;  
In this project, you will comment on how the ideas in the same passage related to other ancient and modern perspectives on race and ethnicty. 

Your goal will be to highlight similarities and differences between the vision of Greekness articulated in this passage and other views of group difference. The goal here is to produce a commentary that gives a college student further insight into how race and ethnicity should be understood in the ancient world.

## Creative Final Project (due May 18, 11:59 PM)
&nbsp;  
The final project represents an opportunity for you to offer your own intepretation of the Satyrica in a way that best fits with whatever creative interests and talents you might have. As such, there is no specified form and content for your final project, other than that it engage with the material of the text that we have been reading and does not take the form of an essay or translation. Some examples of creative projects that you might undertake include (but are certainly not limited to) coming up with a modern playlist to accompany the Cena, illustrating a graphic novel based a portion of the text, making tombstones for different characters who appear at the feast, or writing your own version of one of the lost scenes from the novel.

In order to ensure that everyone's final project fits the bill and that you start working on it well in advance of the due date, you will be required to meet with me by April 5 to propose your project and explain the scope that you iagine. We will meet again two weeks later to discuss your progress and establish a personal rubric for a successful project.

Completion of the final project is necessary to pass the class.
