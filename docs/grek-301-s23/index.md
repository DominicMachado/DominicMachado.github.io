The Greek historian Herodotus of Halicarnassus lived in the 5th century BCE and wrote his *Histories* in the context of the contemporaneous rise of the Athenian Empire. Composed in nine books, the Histories did not chronicle contemporaneous events, but rather provided his readers with a fascinating portrait of people, places, and the events all across the Mediterranean. Ending with an enthralling account of the Persian War (490 - 479 BCE), Herodotus sets out to tell about the *thaumata* (marvels) that he has discovered in his investigation of the ancient Mediterranean past.

In this course, we will read excerpts from the first four books of the *Histories* in hopes of exploring how Herodotus understood and constructed difference between different groups of people in the ancient Mediterranean world. We will do so using the lens of race and ethnicity to think critically about how Herodotus operates and to meditate on differences and similarities between the ancient Mediterranean and the world we inhabit today.
