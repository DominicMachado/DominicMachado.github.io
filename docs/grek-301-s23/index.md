The Greek historian Herodotus of Halicarnassus lived in the 5th century BCE and wrote his Histories in the context of the contemporaneous rise of the Athenian Empire. Composed in nine books, the Histories did not chronicle contemporaneous events, but rather provided his readers with a fascinating portrait of people, places, and the events all across the Mediterranean. Ending with an enthralling account of the Persian War (490 - 479 BCE), Herodotus sets out to tell about the thaumata (marvels) that he has discovered in his investigation of the ancient Mediterranean past.
