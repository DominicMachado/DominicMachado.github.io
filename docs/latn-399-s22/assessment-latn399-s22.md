Below you will find a summary of all the major assessments for this course. For the grading schema for course, see the [specifications grading](https://dominicmachado.github.io/specification-grading-latn399-s22) page.

## Commonplace Book
&nbsp;  
Throughout the course, you will keep a type of journal, known as a commonplace book, in which you will record and reflect on passages in your readings that stand out to you. The hope is that keeping a commonplace will make you a more attentive reader, more reflective thinker, and more active class participant.

Your grade on the commonplace book will be determined by the percentage of satisfactory entries that you complete. Further details on the commonplace book assignment can be found [here](https://dominicmachado.github.io/commonplace-book-latn399-s22).

## Translation Assigments
&nbsp;  
You will have two assignments in which you will be asked to produce a definitive translation of a passage from Petronius. Through consultation with the original text as well as modern commentaries and translations of the passage, you will produce a translation of the passage that is not only grammatically accurate and idiomatic, but one that reflects the tone of passage, presents a clear narrative of events, and takes a strong stance on any controversial aspects within it. Put another way, it represent not just a word-for-word translation of the passage, but an interpretation of it. 

In addition to producing a translation, you will also write a 500 - 600 word reflection on the process of coming up with your translation. In this reflection, you will explain why you chose a particular tone in the passage or why you used a particular English phrase that wasn't a word for word translation of the Latin. You will also highlight the places where you had to make a decision regarding the interpretation of a word or phrase and how you reconciled the difference in opinion that you found in commentaries or other translations.

Further details on the assignment can be found [here](link here).

## Podcast Project (due: December 18)
&nbsp;  
For this project, you will record a 15 minute video podcast on Zoom/Google Meet/YouTube/your phone centering around three passages from your commonplace book. You will discuss these passages in detail, drawing attention to the important themes in Greek history that they bring out and reflecting on the value of reading these sources in the present day.

The intended audience of your podcast project will be your friends and family, so be sure to provide adequate context for your discussion. Further details can be found on the Podcast project [page](https://dominicmachado.github.io/podcast-project-clas141-f20).
