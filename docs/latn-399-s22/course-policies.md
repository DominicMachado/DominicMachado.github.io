# Course Policies - LATN 399 - S22

***
## Course Policies
&nbsp;  
Below you will find all of my official policies as well as relevant links to the college's official policies on these matters.

***

### COVID-19 Policies
&nbsp;  
I recognize and understand the difficult times we are all in. The COVID-19 pandemic impacts us all in many ways, including physically, mentally, emotionally, financially, academically, and professionally. I will work with you on challenges you may be encountering and to provide support to help you succeed.

I expect that all everyone to wear a mask in class, in line with the latest CDC guidelines. If the situation changes to one where masks indoors are not required, I will reevaluate the policy, but I expect it to remain enforced throughout the entire semester.

If, for any reason, you are not clear, according to HC Clear, to attend class, please do not come to class. If you are unable to attend class for such reasons, you can attend class virtually using our course's [standing Zoom link](https://holycross.zoom.us/j/94328868979). In addition, let me know as soon as you know that you will be missing class and I will work with you to keep you up to date on course material.

If I have to miss class for COVID-related reasons, I will be in touch with you as soon as I can as to the way that we will proceed going forward. Depending on the situation, we will likely have to resort to Zoom meetings in lieu of in-person class.

Finally, because there will not be social distancing in classrooms for Fall 2021, students sitting near a student who tests positive will most likely be close contacts. As such, the College will want to identify students sitting near the student who tested positive. In order to facilitate contact tracing, I will ask that students sit in the same seat for the entire semester so that I can create class seating maps for the classroom.

### Absence Policy
&nbsp;  
If you miss or are going to miss class for non-COVID 19 reasons, please e-mail me to let me know what is going on. That way we can work together to ensure that you can stay up-to-date with what’s going on with the class. Should your absence fall under the college’s policy on excused absence, as described [here](https://catalog.holycross.edu/requirements-policies/academic-policies/#coursepoliciestext), you will have an opportunity to make up any missed assessments.

***

### Academic Integrity
&nbsp;  
You are expected to abide by Holy Cross’ Academic Integrity Policy, posted [here](https://catalog.holycross.edu/requirements-policies/academic-policies/#academicintegritytext). Cheating on any assignment (for instance, using unauthorized notes to help answer questions, copying another student’s answers, or employing online translation programs) will result in penalties ranging from a failure on the specific assignment or quiz to failure for the entire course.

### Accommodations
&nbsp;  
Students who need accommodations should notify the instructor as soon as possible and work through the [Office of Accessibility Services](https://www.holycross.edu/health-wellness-and-access/office-accessibility-services).

***

### Statement of Diversity and Inclusivity
&nbsp;  
It is my intent that students from all backgrounds and perspectives be well-served by this course, that students' learning needs be addressed both in and out of class, and that the diversity that the students bring to this class be viewed as a resource, strength and benefit. It is my intent to present materials and activities that are respectful of diversity: gender identity, sexuality, disability, age, socioeconomic status, ethnicity, race, nationality, religion, and culture. Your suggestions are encouraged and appreciated. Please let me know ways to improve the effectiveness of the course for you personally, or for other students or student groups.

***

### Remote Access and Recording of Class Sessions
&nbsp;  
I do not plan on recording class sessions, but please note that, consistent with applicable federal and state law, this course may
be video/audio recorded as an accommodation only with permission from the Office of Accessibility Services.
