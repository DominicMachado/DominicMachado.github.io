# Specifications Grading - LATN 399 - S22

***

We will use not a conventional grading system in this course. Instead, we will adopt a version of specification grading, an assessment system in which assignments are graded on a satisfactory/unsatisfactory scale. Each assignment will have a clearly articulated rubric for achieving a satisfactory grade. Semester grades will be assigned based on the number and type of satisfactory assignments completed. The aim of employing such a system of evaluation is to give you control over your grades. Grades are not arbitrarily assigned – they are earned by the work that you do. Further, you get to decide exactly how much time and energy you want to commit to the course in order to achieve the grade you desire – the course has a few basic minima but most activities are optional.

Below is the rubric for course grades:

|      | A | A- | B+ | B | B- | C | D |
| :---------: | :---------: | :---------: | :---------: | :---------: | :---------: | :---------: | :---------: |
| Translation Paper | 2 | 2 | 2 | 2 | 2 | 1 | 1 |
| Commonplace Book  | 20 | 19 | 18 | 17 | 16 | 14 | 12 |
| Final Creative Project | X | X | X | X | X | X | X |
| Opuscula | 4 | 3 | 2 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 0 |

To achieve a certain grade level, students must complete the listed number of satisfactory assignments from each of the seven different categories (i.e. students who want to earn a B– must satisfactorily complete 16 commonplace book entries, two translation papers, and the final creative project). When students have completed the minimum number of satisfactory assignments for their desired final grade, they do not need to submit any more assignments of that type.

There are some opportunities you to revise your work if you do not earn a satisfactory grade. You are allowed to revise both of your translation papers, if you do not earn a satisfactory on your first attempt. You will also be allowed to revise one unsatisfactory commonplace book entry.

NB: To earn a passage, you need to complete 12 commonplace book entries, one translation paper, and the final creative project.
