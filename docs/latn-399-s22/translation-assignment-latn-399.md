**Overview**

For this assignment, you will be asked to produce a definitive translation of a particular passage from Petronius. Through consultation with the original text as well as modern commentaries and translations of the passage, you will produce a translation of the passage that is not only grammatically accurate and idiomatic, but one that reflects the tone of passage, presents a clear narrative of events, and takes a strong stance on any controversial aspects within it. Put another way, it represent not just a word-for-word translation of the passage, but an interpretation of it. In terms of moving beyond the process of grammatical translation, I encourage you to read and contemplate Johanna Hanink's article on [translation](https://eidolon.pub/the-twists-and-turns-of-translation-33f1272dffa8) and Emily Wilson's [interview](http://runcimanaward.org/2018/05/24/an-interview-with-emily-wilson-translator-of-homers-odyssey-part-2/) about the process of translation.

In addition to producing a translation, you will also write a 500 - 600 word reflection on the process of coming up with your translation. In this reflection, you will explain, for instance, why you chose a particular tone in the passage or why you used a particular English phrase that wasnâ€™t a word for word translation of the Latin. You will also highlight the places where you had to make a decision regarding the interpretation of a word or phrase and how you reconciled the difference in opinion that you found in commentaries or other translations. You will also discuss how Hanink and Wilson's views on translation helped you to move beyond a more literal translation.

Below you will find the passage for translation, as well as links to several translations and commentaries on that passage.
