When we think about race in 21st century America, our minds immediately think of its epidermic manifestation: skin color. Indeed, due to the realities of the transatlantic slave trade and the colonization of the Americas, our perception of race revolves around the dichotomy between Blackness and whiteness. But race, as scholars over the last half century have shown, is not simply reducible to skin color - it is malleable, mercurial technology that serves to distribute power abd privilege within society.

In this course, we will study how race functioned in a society - the ancient Mediterranean world - where skin color was not a primary marker of difference. We will examine the different ways in which the people of the ancient Mediterranean world constructed racial difference to create social and political hierarchies as well as how this thinking was shaped by the unique historical circumstances of the period. My hope is that our examination will unveil what  is at the heart of what we refer to as race and, in the process, reveal much about the way the ancient and modern worlds work.
