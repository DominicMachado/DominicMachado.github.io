# Attendance and Engagement - CLAS 199 - S24

***

## Guidelines
&nbsp;

Attendance, reading, and active participation are essential to achieving our course goals. Please be sure to bring a copy of the assigned reading to class, whether printed out or on a device. 

I expect everyone to be active and engaged contributors in class. This means that we all prepare fully ahead of time, and during class we work to facilitate and promote a stimulating conversation in which no single voice dominates, and all voices are heard. In our classroom, each person is valued and respected. 

Simultaneously, our classroom is a space where we can push, critique, and probe ideas, openly and respectfully, in a spirit of free inquiry.

## Assessment Criteria
&nbsp;

You can receive up to two engagement points per class (48 total possible points). To earn a satisfactory grade for class participation, you must earn 45 out of the possible 48 participation points.  

You will receive one point by showing up and demonstrating ongoing attentiveness and active listening. You will receive the second point by participating meaningfully. Here are some guidelines for meaningful class participation:
 
- Ask a question or make a comment about something we’re discussing in class.
- Ask a question or make a comment about one of the readings.
- Ask a question or make a comment that encourages another person to elaborate on something s/he/they said.
- Make a comment that underscores the link between two people’s contributions.
- Make a comment indicating that you found another person’s ideas interesting or useful.  Be specific as to why this was the case.
- Contribute something that builds on, or springs from, what someone else said.  Be explicit about the way you are building on the other person’s thoughts.
- When you think it’s appropriate, ask the group for a moment’s silence to slow the pace of conversation to give you, and others, time to think.
- Make a summary observation that takes into account several people’s contributions, or that touches on a recurring theme.
- Find a way to express appreciation for the enlightenment you have gained from the discussion.  Try to be specific about what it was that helped you understand something better.
 
If you are a “quiet learner,” make sure to come talk with me. There are alternative ways to have your voice heard, from reflective emails after class to meeting with me during student hours to discuss your ideas.
