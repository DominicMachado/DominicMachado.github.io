# Oral Exam - CLAS 199 - S24

***

## Assignment Overview
&nbsp;

The final requirement for the course will be an in-person conversation between the two of us in which you will demonstrate your learning this semester and your engagement with the texts and critical notions of race. As you prepare, consider how you have learned over the course of the semester to read, analyze, and interpret ancient texts and their relationship to race. I have chosen to make this an oral assignment because it will allow this to be a conversation in which we can share ideas and practice curiosity, and in which I can offer feedback or ask follow-up questions. This conversation is an opportunity for learning for all of us during the completion of an assignment, and I hope it will provide a satisfying and invigorating way to end the semesterâ€”that is the spirit of the assignment.
