## Course policies
&nbsp;  
Below you will find all of my official policies as well as relevant links to the college's official policies on these matters.

### Attendance and Absences
&nbsp;  
If you miss or are going to miss class, please email to let me know what is going on. That way we can work together to ensure that you can stay up-to-date with what’s going on with the class. Should your absence fall under the college’s policy on excused absence, as described [here](https://www.holycross.edu/sites/default/files/files/registrar/excused_absence_policy.pdf), you will have an opportunity to make up any missed assessments.

In the event that I have to miss class for any reason, I will contact you all as soon as I am able.

### Academic Integrity
&nbsp;  
You are expected to abide by Holy Cross’ Academic Integrity Policy, posted [here](https://www.holycross.edu/media/214411/download). If you have any questions about academic honesty and what it entails, do not hesitate to ask me. 

NB: The library also has a useful [guide](https://libguides.holycross.edu/academichonesty) about the nuances around academic honesty.

### Accommodations
&nbsp;  
We all learn differently, and I am committed to making class as accessible as possible for all students. If there is anything I can do to facilitate your learning, please email or speak with me. 

Officially, students in need of special accommodations must register with the [Office of Accessibility Services](https://www.holycross.edu/office-student-accessibility-services). Once the office receives documentation supporting the request for accommodation, the student would meet privately with Accessibility Services to discuss reasonable and appropriate accommodations. The office can be reached by calling 508-793-3693 or by visiting Hogan Campus Center, room 505. 

If you are already registered with Accessibility Services, please be sure to get your accommodation letters and deliver them to your instructors in a timely fashion. Please note that, consistent with applicable federal and state law, this course may be video and/or audio recorded as an accommodation only with permission from the Office of Accessibility Services.  

### Statement of Diversity and Inclusivity
&nbsp;  
It is my intent that students from all backgrounds and perspectives be well-served by this course, that students' learning needs be addressed both in and out of class, and that the diversity that the students bring to this class be viewed as a resource, strength and benefit. It is my intent to present materials and activities that are respectful of diversity: gender identity, sexuality, disability, age, socioeconomic status, ethnicity, race, nationality, religion, and culture. Your suggestions are encouraged and appreciated. Please let me know ways to improve the effectiveness of the course for you personally, or for other students or student groups.
