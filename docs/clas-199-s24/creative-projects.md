## Creative Project #1: Make a Youtube Video!
&nbsp;

**Details**
- Due: February 14-17 (share with me via email)
- Length: 10 - 12 minutes
- Format: .mov/.wmv

***

## Assignment
&nbsp;

Over the last few weeks, we have been delving into the study of race as an ideological and historical concept. We have looked into how it has been theorized, different approaches to studying it, and its applications in the ancient Mediterranean world. This project asks you to create a short video lesson for future Holy Cross students summarizing and reflecting what we have learned about so far in the class in a discrete and digestible format.

Your video lesson (10 -12 minutes) should 1) define three key terms - race, racial formation, and racecraft; 2) use concrete examples to clarify what these terms mean and how they are different; 3) discuss the challenges that come with attempting to apply this framework to the ancient Mediterranean world; and 4) reflect on why it is important for Holy Cross students to be familiar with these concepts. In addition to producing the video, please share a works cited page with a list of works that you reference and as well as a list of any picture or visual media that you in your video. If you are unsure how create a works cited page, please take at Holy Cross' [citation guide](https://libguides.holycross.edu/citationhelp).

You may use the Media Suites of the Multimedia Resource Center in Stein 324 OR the Production Studio of Digital Media Services in Stein 104. They have great equipment and services, including a green screen, professional lighting, professional cameras, and post-production work like titles, overlays, etc. If you are interested in using their services, you need to organize a meeting with them ASAP.

Most importantly, have fun!!!!

- Length: One creative engagement and an artist's statement (400 words)

## Assignment
&nbsp;

Over the last few weeks, we have been studying how people in the ancient Mediterranean engaged in racial thinking and put it to use for political purpose. The purpose of this second project is to respond to these ideas, show how you have assimilated it, and add your own insight and perspective on it. 

Your creative reenvisioning will center around a theme or aspect of race in the ancient world that we have discussed in class, drawing specifically on at least one ancient text we’ve read in this course. You could reinterpret your passage/theme through a piece of “Fan Fiction,” a short story, a set of poems, a song, or by creating visual imagery. You could rewrite or write your own version of a passage for performance, translate it for online format, or record a podcast. There are numerous options!

All creative projects must be submitted with a title and Artist’s Statement. The Artist’s Statement must be at least 400 words and describe how you chose your topic, text(s), and approach. It should address the artistic choices you made in your creative adaptation and what you hoped to express in this adaptation; and what you intended to capture and/or change from the original. Then comment on what you found enjoyable about the project, what was challenging, and what you learned from making it.
