## Creative Project #1: Make a Youtube Video!
&nbsp;

**Details**
- Due: February 14-17 (share with me via email)
- Length: 10 - 12 minutes
- Format: .mov/.wmv
 
## Assignment
&nbsp;

Over the last few weeks, we have been delving into the study of race as an ideological and historical concept. We have looked into how it has been theorized, different approaches to studying it, and its applications in the ancient Mediterranean world. This project asks you to create a short video lesson for future Holy Cross students summarizing and reflecting what we have learned about so far in the class in a discrete and digestible format.

Your video lesson (10 -12 minutes) should 1) define three key terms - race, racial formation, and racecraft; 2) use concrete examples to clarify what these terms mean and how they are different; 3) discuss the challenges that come with attempting to apply this framework to the ancient Mediterranean world; and 4) reflect on why it is important for Holy Cross students to be familiar with these concepts. In addition to producing the video, please share a works cited page with a list of works that you reference and as well as a list of any picture or visual media that you in your video. If you are unsure how create a works cited page, please take at Holy Cross' [citation guide](https://libguides.holycross.edu/citationhelp).

You may use the Media Suites of the Multimedia Resource Center in Stein 324 OR the Production Studio of Digital Media Services in Stein 104. They have great equipment and services, including a green screen, professional lighting, professional cameras, and post-production work like titles, overlays, etc. If you are interested in using their services, you need to organize a meeting with them ASAP.

Most importantly, have fun!!!!
