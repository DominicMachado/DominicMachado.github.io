## Mastery Assessments - 200 points
&nbsp;  
We will have four mastery assessments (50 points each) that test you comprehensively on your knowledge of Latin vocabulary and morphology. The point of these assessment is to give you an opportunity to show your mastery of some fundamental building blocks of the Latin language. Because the knowledge tested on these quizzes is essential to the course, they will be graded on a pass-fail basis, with a score of 90% or higher required for a pass. 

You will have unlimited opportunities to retake these quizzes to earn a pass. In order to retake a quiz, you must email me and set up a date and time for me to administer the quiz retake.

## Translations - 200 points
&nbsp;  
Instead of more traditional assessments, you will have a series of eight take-home assignments. Four of these will be translations (50 points each). These assignment will assess your ability to analyze a Latin passage grammatically and syntactically and then translate that passage from Latin into English.

These translations will be made available to you via Google Docs roughly two weeks before the due date. You will submit these assignments by sharing them with me as a Google Doc by 9:45 AM EST on the day designated by the syllabus.

You will have an opportunity to revise your first three translation assignments so that you can build on the work you did in the initial assignment. Revisions will allow you to earn back up to half of the points you lost. In order to receive credit for your revisions, you will submit your corrections to me by email within two weeks of receiving your grade and then set up a meeting in office hours to go over them with me.

## Compositions - 200 points
&nbsp;  
The other four take-home assignments will be compositions (50 points each). These assignments will ask you to compose a short passage in Latin using prompts and vocabulary that I will provide in advance. They will assess how well you understand the grammatical and syntactic structures that we have reviewed in class. Your composition will be graded on a excellent/satisfactory/unsatisfactory scale (50 points for excellent; 42.5 points for satisfactory; 0 points for unsatisfactory).

These compositions will be made available to you via Google Docs roughly two weeks before the due date. You will submit these assignments by sharing them with me as a Google Doc by 9:45 AM EST on the day designated by the syllabus.

You will have an opportunity to revise your first three composition assignments so that you can build on the work you did in the initial assignment. Your revision will help you to to turn an unsatisfactory into a satisfactory/excellent. In order to receive credit for your revisions, you will submit your corrections to me by email within two weeks of receiving your grade and then set up a meeting in office hours to go over them with me.
