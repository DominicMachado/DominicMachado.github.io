## Unit 3 - Structures within sentences and more verbs

***

### Narrative Overview
&nbsp;

In Unit 1, we learned how verbs and nouns conjugate and decline to create meaning and structure in Latin sentences and we built on this foundation and begin to read more complex sentences (cum clauses and prepositional clauses) in Unit 2. Unit 3 will introduce you to some more complex structures and new verbal forms that appear commonly in the Latin language.

We will consider the place of the [infinitive](https://lingualatina.github.io/textbook/presentation/04-verbal-nouns-and-adjectives/infinitives/#infinitives) in Latin syntax. We will learn the present and perfect forms of the infinitive and discuss three [usages](https://lingualatina.github.io/textbook/presentation/04-verbal-nouns-and-adjectives/infinitives/#uses-of-the-infinitive) of the infinitive: 1) as the subject of a Latin sentence; 2) as a word that complete the meaning of certain verbs; 3) as the main verb in an [indirect statement](https://lingualatina.github.io/textbook/presentation/06-indirect-statement/) (paraphrases but not quotations of what someone else has said).  

We will start by learning the conjugation of several very common irregular verbs including possum, volo, and nolo. This will not only help us to recognize these verbs when they show up in Latin texts, but also provide an opportunity to review the fundamentals of verb formation. We will also learn about deponent and semi-deponent verbs, a special class of verbs that are passive in form but active in meaning. In addition to learning these new forms, we will also learn two more tenses of the subjunctive, the present and perfect.

We will make use of these verbal forms as continue to practice translating complex sentences. We will continue to focus on translating indirect statements as well as temporal clauses with and without the subjunctive.
