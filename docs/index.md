# Prof. Machado's Homepage

Hi! My name is Dominic Machado and I am currently an Assistant Professor at the College of the Holy Cross.

I live in Shrewsbury, MA with my wife, Janice, and three-year old son, William. When I am not teaching or researching, I love to watch and play sports, eat delicious food, and read a good book.
