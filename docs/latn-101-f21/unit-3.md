## Unit 3 - Questions, Paraphrasing, and Possibilities

***

### Narrative Overview
&nbsp;

In Unit 1 and 2, we learned how verbs and nouns conjugate and decline to create meaning and structure in Latin sentences, as well as how to express ideas like time and place using prepositional phrases. In Unit 3, we will build on this foundation and begin to increase diverse and complex sentence types.

We will begin this unit by thinking about how to ask [questions](https://lingualatina.github.io/textbook/presentation/05-questions/#questions) in Latin. By looking at how questions work, we will gain a deeper understanding of how word order signals meaning in Latin. In learning about questions, we will meet the [interrogative pronoun](https://lingualatina.github.io/textbook/presentation/05-questions/#interrogative-pronoun), which will help to lay the foundation for understanding relative pronouns and clauses next semester. We will also meet the [subjunctive mood](https://lingualatina.github.io/textbook/presentation/05-questions/#deliberative-subjunctive) for the first time and learn how to form its [present](https://lingualatina.github.io/textbook/presentation/07-subjunctive/#present-subjunctive) and [imperfect](https://lingualatina.github.io/textbook/presentation/07-subjunctive/#imperfect-subjunctive) tenses of the subjunctive. In doing so, we will start to discuss what the subjunctive mood signifies in Latin, a discussion that we will continue for much of the next two semesters.

We will then move on to consider the place of the [infinitive](https://lingualatina.github.io/textbook/presentation/04-verbal-nouns-and-adjectives/infinitives/#infinitives) in Latin syntax. We will learn the present and perfect forms of the infinitive and discuss three [usages](https://lingualatina.github.io/textbook/presentation/04-verbal-nouns-and-adjectives/infinitives/#uses-of-the-infinitive) of the infinitive: 1) as the subject of a Latin sentence; 2) as a word that complete the meaning of certain verbs; 3) as the main verb in an [indirect statement](https://lingualatina.github.io/textbook/presentation/06-indirect-statement/) (paraphrases but not quotations of what someone else has said). These usages will set us up to meet new and more complex constructions.

Finally, we will consider review and expand our knowledge of two things that we have discussed before: pronouns and verbs. We will learn about [personal pronouns](https://lingualatina.github.io/textbook/reference/pronouns-paradigms/#personal) and a special type of verb known as [deponent verbs](https://lingualatina.github.io/textbook/presentation/09-pron-dep-irreg/#deponent-verbs).
