### Course Information
&nbsp;  
- **Meeting Time:** MWF 2:00 - 2:50 PM
- **Meeting Place:** Stein 134
- **Instructor** Prof. Machado
- **Student Hours**: T, Th 1 - 2:30 PM; Fenwick 413
- **E-mail**: dmachado@holycross.edu

Latin 101 is the first semester in a two-semester introduction to the Latin language. By analyzing, translating, and composing Latin, students will learn to read real ancient texts from the start of our study. At the same time, we will explore how engaging with Latin as a historical language can offer new perspectives on the ancient world, the way we view ourselves and our society, and the construction of structures of power over time. A central component of this course is weekly engagement with the Worcester community, through which students will see how Latin continues to shape the world around us. The course’s emphasis on the relationship between our work and broad ethical concerns is in keeping with Holy Cross’ Mission, the shared commitment to “seeking justice within and beyond the Holy Cross community.”

In the first semester, we will learn the nuts and bolts of the Latin language, with a particular focus on gaining a solid grasp of morphology (i.e. its forms) and syntax (i.e. grammar and sentence structure). We will use these skills to read several stories about the hero, Hercules, as recorded by the 1st-century CE mythographer, Hyginus. We will also delve into the reasons why we are still studying Latin at Holy Cross in 2021 and consider the larger social and moral obligations that come with it.

### Important Information
&nbsp;  
Everything that you need to know about this course is on this website. You can find out about [course objectives](https://dominicmachado.github.io/course-objectives-latn101-f21), [course policies](https://dominicmachado.github.io/schedule-course-policies-latn101-f21), [assessment](https://dominicmachado.github.io/assessment-latn101-f21), and our [full course schedule](https://dominicmachado.github.io/schedule-latn101-f21).

We will not but using a physical textbook, but rather an online [textbook](https://lingualatina.github.io/textbook/) created by myself and several other colleagues in our department. Here you can find all sorts of useful readings, exercises, and resources to use. The faculty teaching LATN 101 have also created a repository of YouTube "lectures" that you can access [here](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCyA2aidE3BiD3idsxrJr5Hg) as well as a set of [additional exercises](https://observablehq.com/collection/@neelsmith/l3).

Finally, I should note that the Department of Classics and the Classics Department Inclusion Committee are pleased to offer a peer-based tutoring program for  Latin 101 students. Our tutors have received training through Academic Services and Learning Resources and will discuss material being covered in the students’ courses, guide students on how to solve problems, and provide independent learning strategies. This program will run as an appointment-based service of 40-minute sessions, with the student and peer tutor working together to find a convenient time.
