# Schedule - LATN 101 - F21

***

This schedule links  to the notes and charts that you'll need throughout the semester. Your homework assignment for almost every class period is to read the notes and charts sections in advance of the class meeting; then, review those concepts again after the class meeting. Use the practice opportunities throughout the notes to improve your skills.

## Final

Additionally, you will submit a final reflection (300-500 words) on your experience in Latin 101 this semester (with a particular focus on what we have done in CBL). In your reflection, you will consider how engaging with Latin as a historical language can offer new perspectives on the ancient world, the way we view ourselves and our society, and the construction of structures of power over time. Things that you might talk about include, but are not limited, to our discussions of gender and pronouns, the passive voice and power, the limited access of classics to students of color, and the "dark side of the subjunctive." This reflection will be due by email on December 18 at 11:59 PM EST.
