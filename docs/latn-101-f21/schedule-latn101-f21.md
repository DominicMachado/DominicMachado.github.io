## Finals

You will have the opportunity to finalize your group's lessons and have them published as a part of publicly-available repository that we will use next semester. The goal is to have a first draft ready by the end of the November 16/17 practicum and the entire project in final form by December 7/8 practicum.

Additionally, you will submit a final reflection (300-500 words) on your experience in Latin 101 this semester (with a particular focus on what we have done in CBL). In your reflection, you will consider what you learned about the intersection of Latin and structures of power and how this relates to larger attempts to create a more just society. Things that you might talk about include, but are not limited, to our discussions of gender and pronouns, the passive voice and power, the limited access of classics to students of color, and the "dark side of the subjunctive." This reflection will be due by email on December 18 at 11:59 PM EST.
