### Introduction
&nbsp;

In Unit 1, you learned how verbs and nouns conjugate and decline to create meaning and structure in Latin sentences.

In Unit 2, we will enrich our understanding of how Latin sentences work with phrases expressing time, place, and purpose as well as two new tenses, the present and the future.
