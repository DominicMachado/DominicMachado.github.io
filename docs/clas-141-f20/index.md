The Parthenon. Democracy. Philosophy. Mythology. Marble Statues. The memory of Ancient Greece casts a long shadow on the world that we live in. In this class, we will explore this world, studying the structures, institutions, and peoples that shaped it. To do so, we will grapple with primary documents written from the ancient world, focusing particularly on the perspective of individuals and groups that have been traditionally deemed unimportant including slaves, women, and foreigners.

### Monday, September 14
- The Problem of Ancient Evidence, Part 2
- **Homework (due before class)**:  Read the accounts of [Thucydides](https://scaife.perseus.org/reader/urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng6:6.54-6.59/) and [Aristotle](http://perseus.uchicago.edu/perseus-cgi/citequery3.pl?dbname=GreekFeb2011&getid=1&query=Arist.%20Ath.%20Pol.%2018) about the murder of Hipparchus. Instead of writing a standard entry in your commonplace book, jot down three conflicting "facts" that you found in your reading and what you think might explain these different interpretations.

### Wednesday, September 16
- Primary Source Analysis Release and Discussion
- **Homework (due before class)**: Instead of writing a standard entry in your commonplace book, reflect on what you have learned from the primary source analysis that we have done in the last two class periods and outline briefly a process for your own primary source analysis.

### Friday, September 18
- The Fundamental Divisions of Greek Society
- **Homework (due before class)**: Read the [Gortyn code](https://diotima-doctafemina.org/translations/anthologies/womens-life-in-greece-and-rome-selections/iv-legal-status-in-the-greek-world/76-laws-relating-to-women/) carefully. In your commonplace book, select a passage that stood out to you and reflect on what it tells you about the culture and society of Gortyn.
