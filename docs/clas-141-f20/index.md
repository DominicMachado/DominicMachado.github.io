The Parthenon. Democracy. Philosophy. Mythology. Marble Statues. The memory of Ancient Greece casts a long shadow on the world that we live in. In this class, we will explore this world, studying the structures, institutions, and peoples that shaped it. To do so, we will grapple with primary documents written from the ancient world, focusing particularly on the perspective of individuals and groups that have been traditionally deemed unimportant including slaves, women, and foreigners.

### Monday, November 9
- Spartan education Between fact and fiction
- **Homework (due before class)**: Read the opening four chapters from the [Constitution of the Spartans](https://scaife.perseus.org/reader/urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0032.tlg010.perseus-eng2:1.1-4.7) about Spartan educational practice. Select one passage from the work and reflect on what this tells us about what was believed to be unique about Sparta in the ancient world and whether you find this to be believable or not given what we have learned about in class in your commonplace book.

### Wednesday, November 11
- Sparta customs
- **Homework (due before class)**: Read the chapter 5 to 8 from the [Constitution of the Spartans](https://scaife.perseus.org/reader/urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0032.tlg010.perseus-eng2:5.1-8.5) about Spartan customs. Select one passage from the work and think about the values, both good and bad, that these customs seem to reflect in your commonplace book.

### Friday, November 13
- Spartan women
- **Homework (due before class)**: Read through the following [selections](https://diotima-doctafemina.org/translations/anthologies/womens-life-in-greece-and-rome-selections/iv-legal-status-in-the-greek-world/98-the-advantages-of-spartan-education-and-marriage-customs/) from the Life of Lycurgus and the alleged [sayings](http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Moralia/Sayings_of_Spartan_Women*.html) of Spartan women recorded by Sparta. Select one passage from these works and reflect on what you believe this tells us about Spartan women and how trustworthy the evidence is.
