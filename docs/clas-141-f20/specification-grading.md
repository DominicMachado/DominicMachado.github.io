# Specifications Grading - CLAS 141 - F20

***

We will use not a conventional grading system in this course. Instead, we will adopt a version of specification grading, an assessment system in which assignments are graded on a satisfactory/unsatisfactory scale. Each assignment will have a clearly articulated rubric for achieving a satisfactory grade. Semester grades will be assigned based on the number and type of satisfactory assignments completed. The aim of employing such a system of evaluation is to give you control over your grades. Grades are not arbitrarily assigned – they are earned by the work that you do. Further, you get to decide exactly how much time and energy you want to commit to the course in order to achieve the grade you desire – the course has a few basic minima but most activities are optional.

Below is the rubric for course grades:

|      | A- | B- | C- | D- |
| :---------: | :---------: | :---------: | :---------: || :---------: |
| Ancient Source Analysis    | X | X | X | X |
| Misconceptions Quiz  | X | X | X | X |
| Non-Elite History Quiz   | X | X | X | X |
| Commonplace Book   | > 90% | 80% - 89.9% | 70% - 79.9% | 60% - 69.9% |
| Attendance  | > 90% | 80% - 89.9% | 70% - 79.9% | 60% - 69.9% |
| Creative Project  | X | X | | |
| Podcast Project  | X | | | |

To achieve a certain grade level, students must complete the listed number of satisfactory assignments from each of the seven different categories (i.e. students who want to earn a B– must satisfactorily complete at least 80% of their commonplace book entries, attend at least 80% of class meetings, the ancient source analysis, the misconceptions quiz, the non-elite history quiz, and the creative project). When students have completed the minimum number of satisfactory assignments for their desired final grade, they do not need to submit any more assignments of that type.

Once you have attained a certain grade level, you can improve your grade within that letter range (i.e. move from a B- to a B or B+, but not to A-). This can be done by meeting the criteria for the commonplace book entries and attendance for the next grade level. For instance, a student in the B- range would move to a B by receiving a grade of satisfactory on 90% or more of their commonplace book entries OR attending more than 90% of class meetings and would earn a B+ by doing both of those things. The one exception to this rule is moving from A- to an A. In order to earn an A, you must have earn satisfactorily complete all your commonplace book entries and attend every class meeting (excused absences excepted).

NB: The misconceptions quiz, the non-elite history quiz, and ancient source analysis must all be completed satisfactorily to pass this class. As a result, you will be able revise or retake these assessments as many times as you would like. However, you must satisfactorily complete these assessments before moving on to either creative project or podcast project.
