## Course policies
&nbsp;  
Below you will find all of my official policies as well as relevant links to the college's official policies on these matters.

### Absence Policy
&nbsp;  
If you miss or are going to miss class, please e-mail me to let me know what is going on. That way we can work together to ensure that you can stay up-to-date with what’s going on with the class. Should your absence fall under the college’s policy on excused absence, as described [here](https://hccatalog.holycross.edu/requirements-policies/academic-policies/#coursepoliciestext), you will have an opportunity to make up any missed assessments.

### Academic Integrity
&nbsp;  
You are expected to abide by Holy Cross’ Academic Integrity Policy, posted [here](https://hccatalog.holycross.edu/requirements-policies/academic-policies/#academicintegritytext). Cheating on any assignment (for instance, using unauthorized notes to help answer questions, copying another student’s answers) will result in penalties ranging from a failure on the specific assignment or quiz to failure for the entire course.

### Accommodations
&nbsp;  
Students who need accommodations should notify the instructor as soon as possible and work through the [Office of Accessibility Services](https://www.holycross.edu/health-wellness-and-access/office-accessibility-services).

### Statement of Diversity and Inclusivity
&nbsp;  
It is my intent that students from all backgrounds and perspectives be well-served by this course, that students' learning needs be addressed both in and out of class, and that the diversity that the students bring to this class be viewed as a resource, strength and benefit. It is my intent to present materials and activities that are respectful of diversity: gender identity, sexuality, disability, age, socioeconomic status, ethnicity, race, nationality, religion, and culture. Your suggestions are encouraged and appreciated. Please let me know ways to improve the effectiveness of the course for you personally, or for other students or student groups.
