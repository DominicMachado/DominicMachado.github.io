## Commonplace Book
&nbsp;  
Throughout the course, you will keep a type of journal, known as a commonplace book, in which you will record and reflect on passages in your readings that stand out to you. The hope is that keeping a commonplace will make you a more attentive reader, more reflective thinker, and more active class participant.

Your grade on the commonplace book will be determined by the percentage of satisfactory entries that complete. Further details on the commonplace book assignment can be found [here](https://dominicmachado.github.io/commonplace-book-clas141-f20).

## Ancient Source Analysis
&nbsp;  
In the Ancient Source Analysis (1000 - 1500 words), you will read a series of sources about an ancient event and assess the historicity of these sources, based on a series of specific criteria. The project is designed to give you practice reading ancient sources closely and evaluating their value as historical evidence in a detailed and rigorous manner.

This project will be grading on a satisfactory/unsatisfactory basis. Passing the ancient source analysis is a prerequisite for passing this class. As such, you will be allowed to revise this project as many times as you want to earn satisfactory grade. Further details can be found on the Ancient Source Analysis [page](https://dominicmachado.github.io/ancient-source-analysis-clas141-f20).
