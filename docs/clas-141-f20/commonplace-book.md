## Commonplace Book

***

**Details**

[Commonplace books](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commonplace_book) were very popular in the 17th and 18th century and offered individuals of that time period a place to make note of passages that they found interesting and reflect on their larger meaning.

Keeping a commonplace book will help you to develop a number of skills that you will need in the course. Most importantly, it will help you to become a better close reader. It will also help you make connections between different readings

- You will select a short sentence/passage (max. 3 sentences) related to the homework prompt and type (**do not copy**) it into your commonplace book.
- You will write one short paragraph (4 to 6 sentences) explaining why the passage stood out to you.
- You will write another short paragraph (4 to 6 sentences) connecting the passage to a different text that we met in an earlier class/reading.
