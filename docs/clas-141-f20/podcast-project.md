# Podcast Project - CLAS 141 - F20

***

## Podcast Project

***

**Details**

- Due: December 18, 11:59 PM EST (by email)
- Length: 15 minutes
- Format: .mp4 file

**Assignment**

For this project, you will record a 15 minute video podcast centering around three passages from your commonplace book. In your video podcast, you will discuss these passages in detail. Your discussion of these passages will focus on two things:

- How these passages reflect on important themes in Greek history that we discussed in class
- How these passages illustrate the value of reading these sources in the present day.

To draw these features out you will connect your chosen passages explicitly to other texts we read in the course and specific events/debates in the present day.

The intended audience of your podcast project is your friends and family. As such, it is important to provide adequate context for your discussion - be sure to provide some basic information about the ancient sources that you are citing throughout the podcast.

In terms of recording, you can make your video podcast on Zoom/Google Meet/YouTube/your phone. Any of these programs should allow you to send the video file to me as an .mp4.

**Assessment**

A satisfactory podcast project will:

- Be roughly 15 minutes in length
- Be sent to me as an .mp4 file
- Contextualize and discuss three passages from your commonplace book
- Connect these passages to the other ancient texts/events that we discussed in class
- Provide the appropriate context for any ancient passages discussed
