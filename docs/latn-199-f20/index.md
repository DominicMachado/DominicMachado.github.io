Latin 199 is meant to serve as an introduction to the reading of Latin at the college level. 	
The course is specifically designed for students who have studied Latin at the high school level for multiple years, but do not yet feel comfortable with reading advanced poetry and prose. The aim of the course to give students the opportunity to improve their knowledge of Latin grammar and syntax, with a view towards enabling reading facility of real Latin texts. As such, the course will be a mix of grammar review and reading practice.

The readings for the course will thematically organized around the character of Hannibal, arguably Rome's greatest enemy. To that end, we will read all of Cornelius Nepos' biography of Hannibal and selections from Book 21 of Livy's Roman history.
