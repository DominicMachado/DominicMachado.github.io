## Case Usages - A Brief Primer
&nbsp;  
Below you will a primer on the usage of the five major cases in Latin. Please jot down any questions that come to mind as you read through the sections below. It is worth noting that some of the terms that I use may not be the ones that you have used in previous classes - I have tried explicitly to simplify the vast terminology frequently used to discuss case usage. Moreover, this primer is not comprehensive, I have focused on usages that you are likely to see in the course of your reading.

***

## Nominative
&nbsp;  
The nominative case is used to provide more information about the subject of a finite verb. There are two main usages of the nominative case in Latin.

1. The nominative can be used to specify the **subject** of a finite verb:
 - **Caesar** Rhenum transire decreverat (Caesar had decided to cross the Rhine).

2. It can also be used predicatively (the so-called **predicate nominative**) to in conjunction with a linking verb to define the subject:
 - Caesar **magnus dux** erat (Caesar was a great leader).

## Genitive
&nbsp;  
The genitive case can be thought of as the case of explanation. The genitive never appears on its own, it is always connected to another word whose meaning it clarifies. Words in the genitive case most commonly are used in conjunction with nouns, but can also appear with adjectives, prepositions, and verbs. It can almost always be translated by using the preposition "of". Below are some of the major usages of the genitive.

1. The genitive can be used to specify the characteristics of another noun:
 - coniuratio **Catilinae** (the conspiracy of Catiline)
 - desiderium **oti** (the desire of leisure)
 - unus **tribunorum** (one of the tribunes)
 - vir **summae virtutis** (a man of the highest courage)

2. The genitive also can be used to complete the meaning of adjectives that express strong emotions (desire, knowledge, memory, fullness, power, sharing, guilt):
 - avidi **laudis** (greedy of praise)
 - plenus **fidei** (full of faith)
 - participes **coniurationis** (sharing in the conspiracy)

3. The genitive can be used to complete the meanings of verbs which express strong emotions (e.g. remembering, forgetting, reminding, accusation or charge, condemnation, pity):
 - **Humanae infirmitatis** memini (I am mindful of human weakness).
 - Miserescite **regis** (Pity the king).

4. The prepositions *causa* and *gratia* take the genitive case:
 - **legendorum librorum** causa (for the sake of reading books)

***

## Dative
&nbsp;  
The dative case can be thought as the winners and losers case. That is, the dative case generally specifies who is affected by the action or existential state of the sentence or clause (hence, the "to" or "for" translation). Thus, the dative frequently provides further context for verbal action, but it can be used with adjectives as well. Below are the four most frequent uses of the dative case.

1. The dative case can be used to indicate to whom or what something is given, granted, entrusted, or refused (the **indirect object**):
 - Do **tibi** librum (I give the book to you).
 - Commendo **tibi** eius omnia negotia (I entrust all his affairs to you).
 - Interdixit **histrionibus** scaenam, (He forbade the actors the stage).

2. The dative can be also used to indicate the person/thing for whom the main idea of the sentence refers (**dative of reference or possession**):
 - Erit ille **mihi** semper deus (That one will always be a god to me).
 - Non **tibi** placet (It is not pleasing to you).
 - Nomen **puellae** Iulia est (The name for the girl is Julia/The girl's name is Julia).

3. The dative can be used to indicate the person/thing which an adjective applies to:
 - Nihil est tam **naturae** aptum (Nothing is so fitted to nature).
 - Sedes non importuna **nostro sermoni** (A place no unsuited to our conversation).

4. It can be used with a [passive periphrastic](https://lingualatina.github.io/textbook/presentation/04-verbal-nouns-and-adjectives/gerunds-and-gerundives/#passive-periphrastic) to clarify who must perform the action of the verb (**dative of agent**):
 - Haec **vobis** provincial est defendenda (This province is to be defended by you).

In addition to these four usages of dative, there are two less frequent but still note-worthy uses of the dative.

1. The dative can be used to specify the purpose of the sentence's core idea (**dative of purpose**, translate "a source of [dative noun]"):
 - Rei publicae **cladi** sunt, “They are a source of ruin to the state”

2. The dative can also be used to complete the meaning of a intransitive "compound" verb (a verb that contains a prepositional prefix like ad, ante, con, in, sub):
 - Virtutes semper **voluptatibus** inhaerent (Virtues always cling to vices).
 - Nec umquam succumbet **inimicis** (Never will he succumb to enemies).

***

## Accusative
&nbsp;  
The accusative can be thought of primarily as a "target" case - it is frequently used to indicate an aim or movement and/or action towards/against a particular person/place/or thing. Accusatives are used primarily with verbal constructions and prepositions, though we will see a couple other usages below.   

1. The accusative is most commonly used as the **direct object** of a transitive verb:
 - Amo **meum puerum** (I love my son).
 - Transivit **flumen** (He crossed the river).

2. It can also function as the object of certain prepositions (ad, ante, contra, in, trans, ob) to indicate motion towards, action against, reason for, or purpose (w/the gerundive):
 - Cucurrit **ad agrum** (He ran towards the field).
 - **Ob id exemplum** laeta erat (She was happy on account of this example).
 - **In Verrem** Cicero dixit (Cicero spoke against Verres).
 - **Ad legendos libros** adsedit (He sat down to read books).

3. The accusative is used as the **subject of an indirect statement**:
 - Dixit **suam puellam** canem eius amare (She said that her own daughter loved her dog).

4. The accusative can stand alone to express an exclamation (**accusative of exclamation**):
 - **Me miserum**! (Wretched me!)
 - O **fortunatam rem publicam**! (Oh, fortunate republic!)

5. Latin expresses the duration of space and time using the accusative:
 - Progressus **milia passuum circiter duodecim** (having set around twelve miles)
 - **Dies triginta** (for thirty days)

***

## Ablative
&nbsp;  
The ablative is often thought of as a do-it-all or the adverbial case in Latin. However, we can categorize all the different usages of the ablative in four major ways:

**A.** It can be used to  describe the relationship between people and things (usually translated with the word **from**):

1. It can indicate from where something comes (e.g. the source, the cause):
  - Rhenus oritur **ex Lepontiis** (the Rhine rises from the country of the Lepontii)
  - factum **de cautibus** antrum, (a cave formed of rocks)
  - **Neglegentia** amabamur (We were loved because of our negligence).

2. It can be used to indicate a lack of something or distance from it (often with verbs of deprivation):
  - **voluptātibus carere** (to lack enjoyments)
  - soluti **a cupiditatibus** (free from desires)
  - abstinere **iniuria** (to abstrain from harm)
  - **Ab insula** ibat (He was going away from the island).

**B.** The ablative can be used to explain how the main action/statement/state of the sentence is accomplished (usually translated as **with**).

1. It can indicate who or what is aiding/participating the completion of an action:
  - Deus **bonis omnibus** explevit mundum (God filled the world with good things).
  - Mundus **ab deo** factus est (The world was made by God).
  - Ambulabam **cum amico meo** (I was walking with my friend).

2. It can be used to add further information about the circumstances of the action/state of the sentence:
 - Dixit versum Graecum **eadem sententia** (He spoke a Greek verse with the same voice).
 - **Virtute** praecedunt
(They excel with respect to courage).
 - Agrum vendidit **pecunia** (He sold land for money).
 - **De virtute** dixit (She spoke about virtue).

**C.** The ablative can be used to indicate a specific point when and when something happens (usually translated with **in**):

1. The ablative can be used in conjunction with a preposition to indicate place where:
 - Vivit **in urbe** (He lives in the city).

2. The ablative is used without a preposition to indicate time when:
 - **prima hora** vigilo (I awake at the first hour).
 - **secunda die** Romam ibant (They were going to Rome on the second day).

**D.** The ablative can be used to indicate a form of comparison.

1. The ablative can be used in conjunction with a comparative adjective to denote what a particular noun is being compared to:
 - Puella **puero** fortior erat (The girl was stronger than the boy).
 - Populus Romanus felicior **Hannibale** fuerunt (The Roman people were luckier than Hannibal).

2. An ablative can be used to indicate the difference between things being compared:
 - Puella puero **multo** fortior erat (The girl was stronger than the boy by much).
