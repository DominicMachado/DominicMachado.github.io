## Competency Quizzes - 150 points
&nbsp;  
We will have three "competency" quizzes (50 points each) - one on verbs, one on nouns, and one on [core vocabulary](http://ww3.haverford.edu/classics/DCC/Vocab/Full/pdf/Nepos-Hannibal-Vocabulary-Repeat3.pdf) - that will test you comprehensively on your knowledge of fundamental building blocks of the Latin language.

Because the knowledge tested on these quizzes is essential to the course, they will be graded on a pass-fail basis. Additionally, you will have unlimited opportunities to revise your quizzes until you earn a pass.

These three quizzes will be made available to you on September 14 and must be submitted by 8:00 AM EST on September 28.

When you do your revisions, please compile all your incorrect answers in a Google Doc with an explanation of your mistake and how you would get to the right answer. What I want to see is that you understand why your answer was incorrect and that you understand why the answer given is the correct one. If, for instance, you wrote that the correct form of bonus, -a, -um to match with feminam is bonem, you would write that bonus, -a, -um is 2-1-2 adjective and that you declined it like a third declension adjective. You would also say that to get to the right answer you would need to find the feminine singular form of bonus, -a, -um, which is bonam. Your first round of revisions will be due on October 16 by 8:00 AM. You will submit your revisions by sharing your Google Doc with me.

## Passage Analysis - 300 points
&nbsp;  
Instead of more traditional assessments, you will have a series of six take-home assignments. Three of these will be passage analyses (100 points possible). These assignments will ask you to analyze a Latin passage grammatically and syntactically at a granular level, with a particular focus on topics discussed in class.

These passages will be made available to you via Google Docs roughly two weeks before the due date, each with a specific set of instructions. You will submit these assignments by sharing them with me as a Google Doc by 8:00 AM EST on the day designated by the syllabus.

## Translations - 300 points
&nbsp;  
The other three take-home assessments will be translations (100 points each) of the passages that you analyzed. You will use your analysis (and my corrections) to translate the passage in two ways. The first way (70 of 100 points) will stick as closely to the grammar of the passage as possible and the second way (30 of 100 points) will attempt to render it into clear, concise English.

These translations will be due one week after you receive your corrected passage analyses from me and will be submitted as a Google Doc by 8:00 AM EST on the day designated by the syllabus.

***

## Final Passage Analysis and Translation - 250 points
&nbsp;  
Your final project will be a slightly longer of version of the take-home assignments that you have done. You will start by doing a close analysis of a passage (125 points) and then write two translations of the passage, one literal (85 points), one literary (40 points).

These passages will be made available to you via Google Docs on December 4. You will submit your final assignment to me as a Google Doc by 11:59 PM EST on December 18.
