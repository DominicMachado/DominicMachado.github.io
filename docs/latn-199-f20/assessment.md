## Competency Quizzes - 150 points
&nbsp;  
We will have three "competency" quizzes (50 points each) early on in the semester that test you comprehensively on your knowledge of Latin's morphological systems. The point of these quizzes is to give you an opportunity to show your mastery of some fundamental building blocks of the Latin language.

Because the knowledge tested on these quizzes is essential to the course, they will be graded on a pass-fail basis. Additionally, you will have unlimited opportunities to revise your quizzes until you earn a pass.

The quizzes will be sent out via Google Forms one week before they are due. These quizzes must be submitted by 11:45 AM EST on the day designated on the syllabus. Your first attempt at revisions must be submitted to me within a week of receiving your grade.

## Passage Analysis - 300 points
&nbsp;  
Instead of more traditional assessments, you will have a series of six take-home assignments. Three of these will be passage analyses (100 points possible). These assignments will ask you to analyze a Latin passage grammatically and syntactically at a granular level, with a particular focus on topics discussed in class.

These passages will be made available to you via Google Docs roughly two weeks before the due date, each with a specific set of instructions. You will submit these assignments by sharing them with me as a Google Doc by 11:45 AM EST on the day designated by the syllabus.

## Translations - 300 points
&nbsp;  
The other three take-home assessments will be translations (100 points each) of the passages that you analyzed. You will use your analysis (and my corrections) to translate the passage in two ways. The first way (70 of 100 points) will stick as closely to the grammar of the passage as possible and the second way (30 of 100 points) will attempt to render it into clear, concise English.

These translations will be due one week after you receive your corrected passage analyses from me and will be submitted as a Google Doc by 11:45 AM EST on the day designated by the syllabus.

## Final Passage Analysis and Translation - 250 points
&nbsp;  
Your final project will be a slightly longer of version of the take-home assignments that you have done. You will start by doing a close analysis of a passage (125 points) and then write two translations of the passage, one literal (85 points), one literary (40 points).

These passages will be made available to you via Google Docs on December 4. You will submit your final assignment to me as a Google Doc by 11:59 PM EST on December 18.
