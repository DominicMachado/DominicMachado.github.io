## How to Read a Latin Sentence
&nbsp;

When reading Latin texts, it can be helpful to approach them with a regular method. Below you will find my suggested method for doing so, but please note that there are many other ways of reading Latin sentences as well:

**Step 1**: Begin by reading the whole sentence aloud in Latin, taking mental note of any words that stand out to you.

**Step 2**: Read through the sentence a second time, mark all the finite verbs.

**Step 3**: Once you have found the finite verbs, look to see which of these verbs are introduced by a subordinating conjunction (e.g. *cum*, *dum*, *si*, *usque*, *ut*, *ne*, *quod*, *quia*, *quamquam*) or a relative pronoun (e.g. *qui*, *quae*, *quod*) and mark out the full subordinate clause using parentheses (NB: All clauses must feature a verb).
  - Open parenthesis whenever you see a subordinating conjunction or relative pronoun.
  - Close parenthesis when you get to the verb.
  - If you see another subordinating conjugation before you get to the verb, open parentheses again. Once you get to the next verb, you will close the parenthesis - this will represent the subordinate clause within the larger subordinate clause. The next verb will be the main verb in the first subordinate clause:
    - E.g. (Si regina, (quae terram rexit), laeta erat)....

**Step 4**: Mark any stated subjects in the sentence.

**Step 5**: Determine if the finite verb requires anything to complete their meaning.  
  - If there is an active transitive verb, this will be a direct object.
  - If there is a linking verb, this will be a predicate nominative.
  - If there is a passive verb, there may be an ablative of agent.
    - Terra **ab reginā** recta est.
  - If there is a verb of the head (i.e. a verb of speaking, seeing, hearing, perceiving), there will be an indirect statement.
    - An indirect statement will feature an accusative and an infinitive.
    - Dixit **terram ab reginā rectam esse**.

**Step 6**: Bracket any prepositional phrases or ablative absolutes.

**Step 7**: Now you are ready to translate:
  - Start by translating the sentence's independent clauses.
  - Then, move on to filling in the rest of the dependent clause in order and translating them to add further detail to the independent clause.

## Sample Sentence
&nbsp;

**Step 1**: Read the sentence aloud.

> Cum Ceres Proserpinam filiam suam quaereret, devenit ad Eleusinum regem, cuius uxor Cothonea puerum Triptolemum pepererat, seque nutricem lactantem simulavit.

**Step 2**: Find the finite verbs (in **bold** here).

> Cum Ceres Proserpinam filiam suam **quaereret**, **devenit** ad Eleusinum regem, cuius uxor Cothonea puerum Triptolemum **pepererat**, seque nutricem lactantem **simulavit**.

**Step 3**: Determine the subordinate clauses and mark them with (parentheses).

> (Cum Ceres Proserpinam filiam suam **quaereret**), **devenit** ad Eleusinum regem, (cuius uxor Cothonea puerum Triptolemum **pepererat**), seque nutricem lactantem **simulavit**.

- *Cum* introduces the first dependent clause
- *Cuius* introduces the second dependent clauses
- The sentence of two independent clauses and joined by *-que*: "**devenit** ad Eleusinum regem seque nutricem lactantem **simulavit**."

**Step 4**: Locate any stated subjects (in *italics* here).

> (Cum *Ceres* Proserpinam filiam suam **quaereret**), **devenit** ad Eleusinum regem, (cuius *uxor Cothonea* puerum Triptolemum **pepererat**), seque nutricem lactantem **simulavit**.

- The two verbs in the dependent clauses do not have a stated subject - this implies that they share a subject with the first stated subject, Ceres.

**Step 5**: Determine what is required to complete the meaning of each clause given its finite verb.

> (Cum *Ceres* ***Proserpinam filiam suam*** **quaereret**), **devenit** ad Eleusinum regem, (cuius *uxor Cothonea* ***puerum Triptolemum*** **pepererat**), ***seque nutricem lactantem*** **simulavit**.

- Three out of the four verbs here are transitive verbs and require a direct object (marked with in ***bolded italics***)
- Notice that **devenit** as an intransitive verb does not need anything to complete the meaning

**Step 6**: Put brackets around any prepositional phrases or ablative absolutes.

> (Cum *Ceres* ***Proserpinam filiam suam*** **quaereret**), **devenit** [ad Eleusinum regem], (cuius *uxor Cothonea* ***puerum Triptolemum*** **pepererat**), ***seque nutricem lactantem*** **simulavit**.

**Step 7**: Start by translating the independent clauses.

> **devenit** [ad Eleusinum regem] ***seque nutricem lactantem*** **simulavit**.

> "[Subject] went to king Eleusis and pretended that she was a wet nurse."

**Step 8**: Move on to translate each of the dependent clauses in order in light of the independent clauses.

> (Cum *Ceres* ***Proserpinam filiam suam*** **quaereret**), **devenit** [ad Eleusinum regem], (cuius *uxor Cothonea* ***puerum Triptolemum*** **pepererat**), ***seque nutricem lactantem*** **simulavit**.

"When Ceres was looking for her daughter, Proserpina, she went to king Eleusis, whose wife Cothonea had given birth to the boy Triptolemus, and pretend that she was a wet nurse."
