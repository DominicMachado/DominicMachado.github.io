# A Guide to Complex Latin Sentences - LATN 199 - F20

## How to Read Complex Latin Sentences
&nbsp;

When reading Latin texts, it can be helpful to approach them with a regular method. Below you will find my suggested method for doing so (with links to more detail for certain steps):

- Begin by reading the whole sentence aloud in Latin, taking mental note of any words that stand out to you
- Read through the sentence a second time, underlining all the finite verbs
- Once you have found the finite verbs, look to see which of these verbs are introduced by a subordinating conjunction (e.g. cum, dum, si, usque, ut, ne, quod, quia, quamquam) or a relative pronoun (e.g. qui, quae, quod)

## Example - Ceres and Triptolemus
&nbsp;

Step 1: Read the sentence aloud

> Cum Ceres Proserpinam filiam suam quaereret, devenit ad Eleusinum regem, cuius uxor Cothonea puerum Triptolemum pepererat, seque nutricem lactantem simulavit.

Step 2: Find the finite verbs (in **bold**)

> Cum Ceres Proserpinam filiam suam **quaereret**, **devenit** ad Eleusinum regem, cuius uxor Cothonea puerum Triptolemum **pepererat**, seque nutricem lactantem **simulavit**.

Step 3: Determine the subordinate clauses

> (Cum Ceres Proserpinam filiam suam **quaereret**), **devenit** ad Eleusinum regem, (cuius uxor Cothonea puerum Triptolemum **pepererat**), seque nutricem lactantem **simulavit**.

- Cum introduces the first dependent clause
- Cuius introduces the second dependent clauses
- The sentence of two independent clauses and joined by -que: "**devenit** ad Eleusinum regem seque nutricem lactantem **simulavit**."

Step 4: Locate any stated subjects (in *italics*)

> (Cum *Ceres* Proserpinam filiam suam **quaereret**), **devenit** ad Eleusinum regem, (cuius *uxor Cothonea* puerum Triptolemum **pepererat**), seque nutricem lactantem **simulavit**.

- The two verbs in the dependent clauses do not have a stated subject - this implies that they share a subject with the first stated subject

Step 5: Determine if each verb requires a direct object and locate the direct objects for those verbs (in ***bold italics***)

> (Cum *Ceres* ***Proserpinam filiam suam*** **quaereret**), **devenit** ad Eleusinum regem, (cuius *uxor Cothonea* ***puerum Triptolemum*** **pepererat**), ***seque nutricem lactantem*** **simulavit**.

- Notice that **devenit** as an intransitive verb does not have a direct object

Step 6: Put brackets around any prepositional phrases or ablative absolutes.

> (Cum *Ceres* ***Proserpinam filiam suam*** **quaereret**), **devenit** [ad Eleusinum regem], (cuius *uxor Cothonea* ***puerum Triptolemum*** **pepererat**), ***seque nutricem lactantem*** **simulavit**.

Step 7: Start with translating the independent clauses.

> **devenit** [ad Eleusinum regem] ***seque nutricem lactantem*** **simulavit**.

> "[Subject] went to king Eleusis and pretend that she was a wet nurse."

Step 8: Move on to translate each of the dependent clauses in order.

> (Cum *Ceres* ***Proserpinam filiam suam*** **quaereret**), **devenit** [ad Eleusinum regem], (cuius *uxor Cothonea* ***puerum Triptolemum*** **pepererat**), ***seque nutricem lactantem*** **simulavit**.

"When Ceres was looking for her daughter, Proserpina, she went to king Eleusis, whose wife Cothonea had given birth to the boy Triptolemus, and pretend that she was a"
