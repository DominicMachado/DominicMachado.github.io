Latin 102 is the second course in a two-semester introduction to the Latin language. This course will build upon the basics of the Latin language introduced in the first semester (e.g., declension, conjugation, complex sentence structure, etc.) and help you develop a strong command of Latin vocabulary, grammar, and syntax. The goal of first-year Latin is to build a solid foundation for reading actual ancient Roman texts. As such, the acquisition of those linguistic skills, elucidated and practiced through classroom practice and translation and composition exercises, will set a foundation for reading unedited Latin from Hyginus’ Fabulae, a compendium of Greco-Roman myth. 

At the same time, we will continue to explore how engaging with Latin as a historical language can offer new perspectives on the ancient world, the way we view ourselves and our society, and the construction of structures of power over time. A central component of this course is our  weekly engagement with the Worcester community, through which students will see how Latin continues to shape the world around us. The course’s emphasis on the relationship between our work and broad ethical concerns is in keeping with Holy Cross’ Mission, the shared commitment to “seeking justice within and beyond the Holy Cross community.”

We will not but using a physical textbook, but rather an online [textbook](https://lingualatina.github.io/textbook/) created by myself and several other colleagues in our department. Here you can find all sorts of useful readings, exercises, and resources to use. 

Finally, I should note that the Department of Classics and the Classics Department Inclusion Committee are pleased to offer a peer-based tutoring program for  Latin 102 students. Our tutors have received training through Academic Services and Learning Resources and will discuss material being covered in the students’ courses, guide students on how to solve problems, and provide independent learning strategies. This program will run as an appointment-based service of 40-minute sessions, with the student and peer tutor working together to find a convenient time.  To set up an appointment with one of the tutors, please contact me.
