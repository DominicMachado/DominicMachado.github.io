## Unit 4 - Irregular Verbs and More Subjunctive Forms

***

### Narrative Overview
&nbsp;

In Unit 1 and 2, we learned how verbs and nouns conjugate and decline to create meaning and structure in Latin sentences, as well as how to express ideas like time and place using prepositional phrases and we built on this foundation and begin to read more complex sentences (cum clauses and indirect statements) in Unit 3. Unit 4 will introduce you to some new verbal forms that appear commonly in the Latin language.

We will start by learning the conjugation of several very common [irregular verbs](https://lingualatina.github.io/textbook/presentation/09-pron-dep-irreg/#irregular-verbs) including *sum*, *possum*, *volo*, *nolo*, *eo*, and *fero*. This will not only help us to recognize these verbs when they show up in Latin texts, but also provide an opportunity to review the fundamentals of verb formation. We will also learn about [deponent](https://lingualatina.github.io/textbook/presentation/09-pron-dep-irreg/#deponent-verbs) and [semi-deponent](https://lingualatina.github.io/textbook/presentation/09-pron-dep-irreg/#semi-deponents) verbs, a special class of verbs that are passive in form but active in meaning. In addition to learning these new forms, we will also learn two more tenses of the subjunctive, the [present](https://lingualatina.github.io/textbook/presentation/07-subjunctive/#present-subjunctive) and [perfect](https://lingualatina.github.io/textbook/presentation/07-subjunctive/#perfect-active-subjunctive).

We will make use of these verbal forms as continue to practice translating complex sentences. We will continue to focus on translating indirect statements as well as temporal clauses with and without the subjunctive.
