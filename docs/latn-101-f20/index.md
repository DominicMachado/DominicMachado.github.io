Latin 101 is the first course in a two-semester introduction to the Latin language. The goal is to read Classical Latin by the end of the year, and in Latin 101 we will cover most of Latin morphology and a good deal of Latin syntax. Alongside our study of the Latin language, we will also have frequent discussions about Latin culture and history and why it still matters today.
