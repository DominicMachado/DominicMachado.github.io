## Quizzes - 150 points
&nbsp;  
We will have five short take-home quizzes (30 points each) that will test you primarily on vocabulary (though the first two quizzes will have some grammar in them as well). The quizzes are designed to ensure that you are doing daily work (i.e. studying and memorizing) necessary to do well in this class.

The quizzes will be sent out via Google Forms one week before they are due. These quizzes must be submitted by 11:45 AM EST on the day designated on the syllabus.

## Competency Quizzes - 150 points
&nbsp;  
We will have three "competency" quizzes (50 points each) that test you comprehensively on your knowledge of Latin's verb and noun systems. The point of these quizzes is to give you an opportunity to show your mastery of some fundamental building blocks of the Latin language.

Because the knowledge tested on these quizzes is essential to the course, they will be graded on a pass-fail basis. Additionally, you will have unlimited opportunities to revise your quizzes until you earn a pass.

The quizzes will be sent out via Google Forms one week before they are due. These quizzes must be submitted by 11:45 AM EST on the day designated on the syllabus. Your first attempt at revisions must be submitted to me within a week of receiving your grade.

## Translations - 300 points
&nbsp;  
Instead of more traditional assessments, you will have a series of ten take-home assignments. Five of these will be translations (60 points possible). These assignment will assess your ability to analyze a Latin passage grammatically and syntactically and then translate that passage from Latin into English.

These translations will be made available to you via Google Docs roughly two weeks before the due date. You will submit these assignments by sharing them with me as a Google Doc by 11:45 AM EST on the day designated by the syllabus.

You will have an opportunity to all revise your translation assignments so that you can build on the work you did in the initial assignment. Revisions will allow you to earn back up to half of the points you lost. In order to receive credit for your revisions, you will submit your corrections to me by email within two weeks of receiving your grade and then set up a meeting in office hours to go over them with me.

## Compositions - 250 points
&nbsp;  
The other five take-home assignments will be compositions. These assignments will ask you to compose a short passage in Latin using prompts and vocabulary that I will provide in advance. They will assess how well you understand the grammatical and syntactic structures that we have reviewed in class. Your composition will be graded on a satisfactory/unsatisfactory scale (50 points for satisfactory; 0 points for unsatisfactory). I am not looking for perfection in these assignments, but adherence to the instructions and a solid effort.

These compositions will be made available to you via Google Docs roughly two weeks before the due date. You will submit these assignments by sharing them with me as a Google Doc by 11:45 AM EST on the day designated by the syllabus.

You will have an opportunity to all revise your composition assignments so that you can build on the work you did in the initial assignment. A satisfactory revision will help you to to turn an unsatisfactory grade into a satisfactory one. In order to receive credit for your revisions, you will submit your corrections to me by email within two weeks of receiving your grade and then set up a meeting in office hours to go over them with me.
