## Final

Submit a final reflection of 500 words on your experience in community-based learning this year. Address the following questions in your reflection:
 
1. What teaching and planning techniques have worked well this semester? What haven’t worked well? Why?
2. What have you learned about how language can be used to give or take power from particular people and groups? 
3. How can Latin and the study of ancient languages and cultures become more accessible to a larger array of individuals and groups? What have you been doing to make this material more accessible in your teaching it to younger audiences? 

Please submit the reflection, as a Google doc shared with me, by Wednesday, May 17 at 11:59 PM.
