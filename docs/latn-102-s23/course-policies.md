## Course policies
&nbsp;  
Below you will find all of my official policies as well as relevant links to the college's official policies on these matters.

### Attendance and Absences
&nbsp;  
With regard to attendance, this course will abide by Holy Cross' [attendance policy](https://catalog.holycross.edu/requirements-policies/academic-policies/#coursepoliciestext). 

If you miss or are going to miss class, please e-mail me as soon as possible to let me know what is going on. That way we can work together to ensure that you can stay up-to-date with what’s going on with the class. Should your absence fall under the college’s policy on excused absence, as described [here](https://catalog.holycross.edu/requirements-policies/academic-policies/#coursepoliciestext), you will have an opportunity to make up any missed assessments.

In the event that I have to miss class for any reason, I will contact you all as soon as I am able.

### Academic Integrity
&nbsp;  
You are expected to abide by Holy Cross’ Academic Integrity Policy, posted [here](https://catalog.holycross.edu/requirements-policies/academic-policies/#academicintegritytext). Breaches of this policy will result in penalties ranging from a failure on the specific assignment or quiz to failure for the entire course. If you have any questions at all about any aspects of this policy and how they apply to the work required in this course, please do not hesitate to talk with me about it!

### Accommodations
&nbsp;  
The College of the Holy Cross is committed “to providing students with disabilities equal access to the educational opportunities and programs available at Holy Cross in accordance with the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 as amended, Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, and Massachusetts laws.” Any student who feels the need for accommodation based on the impact of a disability should contact the [Office of Accessibility Services](https://www.holycross.edu/health-wellness-and-access/office-accessibility-services) to discuss support services available. Once the office receives documentation supporting the request for accommodation, the student would meet
privately with the office to discuss reasonable and appropriate accommodations. The office can be reached by calling 508-793-3693.

If you are already registered with Accessibility Services, please be sure to get your accommodation letters and deliver them to me in a timely fashion. 

Since it is my goal to create a learning environment that is beneficial for all students, I want to also make myself available to you for discussions along these lines. So please do not hesistate to talk with me about what I can do to facilitate your learning!  

### Statement of Diversity and Inclusivity
&nbsp;  
It is my intent that students from all backgrounds and perspectives be well-served by this course, that students' learning needs be addressed both in and out of class, and that the diversity that the students bring to this class be viewed as a resource, strength and benefit. It is my intent to present materials and activities that are respectful of diversity: gender identity, sexuality, disability, age, socioeconomic status, ethnicity, race, nationality, religion, and culture. Your suggestions are encouraged and appreciated. Please let me know ways to improve the effectiveness of the course for you personally, or for other students or student groups.

### Remote Access and Recording of Class Sessions
&nbsp;  
I do not plan on recording class sessions, but please note that, consistent with applicable federal and state law, this course may
be video/audio recorded as an accommodation only with permission from the Office of Accessibility Services.
