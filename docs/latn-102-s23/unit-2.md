### Narrative Overview
&nbsp;  
In Unit 1, we spent some time reviewing key concepts from last semester. In Unit 2, we will learn about different ways in which nouns, adjectives, and pronouns can be used to add further color to a Latin sentence.

We will begin by learning about [relative clauses](https://lingualatina.github.io/textbook/2021-2022/11-relative-clauses/overview/), a type of dependent clause that provides further information about a previous noun. We will then move on to learn about [participles](https://lingualatina.github.io/textbook/2021-2022/10-participles/overview/), a type of verbal adjective, that provides more information about the actions and behaviors of a noun within a sentence. We will conclude by looking at [gerunds (verbal nouns) and gerundives (verbal adjectives)](https://lingualatina.github.io/textbook/2021-2022/04-verbal-nouns-and-adjectives/gerunds-and-gerundives/) and the different constructions that they belong to.

### Objectives
&nbsp;  
By the end of Unit 2, you will be able to:

- Recognize relative clauses and analyze their grammatical function in sentences
- Recognize participles and understand how they add complexity to sentences
- Recognize gerunds and gerundives and identify the way that they are being used in sentences
