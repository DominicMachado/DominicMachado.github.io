## Creative Project #1: Make a Youtube Video!

**Details**

- Due: September 21, 3 PM EST (share with me via email)
- Length: 7 - 10 minutes
- Format: .mov/.wmv
 
**Assignment**

Over the last few weeks, we have been delving into the study of race as an ideological and historical concept. We have looked into how it has been theorized, different approaches to studying it, and its historical trajectory. This project asks you to create a short video lesson for future Holy Cross students summarizing and reflecting what we have learned about so far in the class in a discrete and digestible format.

Your video lesson (7-10 minutes) should 1) define four key terms - race, racial formation, racecraft, and critical race theory; 2) use concrete examples to clarify what these terms mean and how they are different; 3) discuss in brief key events in historical development of racially-based thinking; and 4) reflect on why it is important Holy Cross students to be familiar with these concepts. In addition to producing the video, please share a works cited page with a list of works that you reference and as well as a list of any picture or visual media that you in your video. If you are unsure how create a works cited page, please take at Holy Cross' [citation guide](https://libguides.holycross.edu/citationhelp).

You may use the Media Suites of the Multimedia Resource Center in Stein 324 OR the Production Studio of Digital Media Services in Stein 104. They have great equipment and services, including a green screen, professional lighting, professional cameras, and post-production work like titles, overlays, etc. If you are interested in using their services, you need to organize a meeting with them ASAP.

## Creative Project #2: Write a Pop Culture Blog Post!

**Details**

- Due: November 2, 3 PM EST (share with me via email)
- Length: 1200 - 1500 words
- Format: Google Doc
 
**Assignment**

So far, we have considered how public intellectuals in the 19th and 20th century used antiquity to create and resist racial narratives. As I have alluded to throughout the course, antiquity is still being used to create and resist racial narrative in the present moment. For this current project, you are going to look at how Lizzo's [*Rumors*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4P9XUrniiK4) and the Carters' [*Apeshit*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbMqWXnpXcA) make use of antiquity to counter and challenge dominant racial narratives. To this end, you will analyze when and where ancient images and themes appear, how the various people in these videos position themselves relative to them, and how this all works challenge narrative of Western civilization and white supremacy that we have discussed in class. 

Instead of writing a formal academic essay, you will be writing your analysis as blog post aimed at both an academic and public audience. What that means is that you should imagine a wide audience that includes your professors, but also your family and friends. Do not assume that your audience has previous knowledge about the ancient world or specific terms that we have learned like race, racecraft, and racethinking. In addition, a key part about making a blog post is using media (pictures, video, memes, tweets) to make your point clearly. Any media you use should be well integrated into the post and add meaning to the larger point you are making. Finally, a key part of the blog post is explain to your audience in broad terms why this example shows the importance of understanding the past.

To give you an idea of what your blog post might look here (these are much longer than 1200-1500 words), have a gander at Anise Strong's blog post on [Beyonce's *Black is King*](https://antiquipop.hypotheses.org/eng/9042eng), Vanessa Stovall and Kiran Mansukhani's blog post on [Lil Nas X's MONTERO](https://classicalstudies.org/scs-blog/vstovall/blog-stripping-men-myth-lil-nas-x%E2%80%99s-reconstitution-greek-tradition-montero-call), and Rihanna's [GQ Cover](https://lizgloyn.wordpress.com/2013/11/01/rhianna-medusa-gq-and-photoshop/).

**Assessment**

A satisfactory project will:
- Be shared via email by November 2 at 3 PM EST
-	Be roughly 1200-1500 words
-	Highlight how antiquity features in Lizzo's *Rumors* and The Carters' *Apeshit*
-	Draw attention to how these artists use and interact with ancient objects and themes to counter narratives of white supremacy and Western civilization
-	Be written in an accessible way that explains to the audience basic concepts from the ancient world and the academic study of race
-	Use media to enhance your explanation and help your audience connect with your writing
-	Reflect on the importance of thinking critically about the ancient world
-	Include works cited list for any references you mentioned in the blog post
