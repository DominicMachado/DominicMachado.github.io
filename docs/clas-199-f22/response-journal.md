**Key Details**

Over the course of this semester, you will be required to keep a response journal. My hope is that keeping a response journal will help you to work towards two of our course goals. First, the process of selecting a short passage and reflecting on it will help you to become a more attentive and mindful reader. Second, looking through your response journal will help you make connections between different readings and discussions we have had in the class. I am also hopeful that the passages that you record will serve as fruitful jumping off points for in-class discussion.

Instead of a physical book, you will keep all your commonplace book entries in a Google Doc which you will share with me. There will be an opportunity to complete a commonplace book entry in advance of most classes.

Each of your commonplace book entries should:

- Begin with a short sentence/passage (max. 3 sentences) from your Latin reading, followed your translation of the sentence/passage
- One paragraph (5 to 7 sentences) explaining why the passage/sentence stood out to you
- Another short paragraph (5 to 7 sentences) connecting the passage/sentence to a different text or reading that we have encountered in the course

**Assessment**

Each individual entry in your commonplace book will be grading on a satisfactory/unsatisfactory basis. 

If a 3-2-1 response is required, a satisfactory response will:

- Be completed by class time (3 PM)
- Offer three key themes
-
- Be written in complete sentences


If a reflection is required, a satisfactory response will:

- Be completed by class time (3 PM)
- Have two short paragraphs explaining why the passage stood out to you and connecting the passage to a different text that we met in an earlier class/reading
- Be written in complete sentences

Your grade for the commonplace book will be determined by the number of satisfactory entries you complete over the course of the semester.
