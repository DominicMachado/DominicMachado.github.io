## Response Journal
&nbsp;  
Throughout the course, you will keep a response journal, in which you will respond to and reflect on assigned readings. These responses work to help you engage more deeply with the readings and will offer us a starting point for in-class discussion.

Your grade on the response journal will be determined by the number of satisfactory entries that you complete and you must complete at least 12 entries to pass the course. Please note that for a response to be counted as satisfactory, it must be turned in by class time on the day that the entry is due on the syllabus.

Further details on the commonplace book assignment can be found [here](https://dominicmachado.github.io/response-journal-clas199-f22).

&nbsp;  
Throughout the course, you will have the opportunity to complete three creative projects (an educational YouTube video; a pop culture blog post; and an interactive timeline) related to different aspects of our course content. These projects are intended to get you thinking in new and creative ways about our course material and encourage you to bring your different talents and perspectives to the work that we are doing together.

You must complete at least one creative project to pass the course. Further details on each of the assignments can be found [here](https://dominicmachado.github.io/creative-projects-clas199-f22).

## Opuscula (due December 7, 3:00 PM)
&nbsp;  
There will be four *opuscula* (mini-projects) that you will have the opportunity to complete over the course of the semester. These projects will ask you to dive deeply into different aspects of the relationship between race and antiquity. By doing these assignments, you will not only learn more about key facets of our topic, but get the chance to explore aspects that you personally find interesting.

Completion of the *opuscula* are not necessary to pass the class. There are no specific due dates for particular *opuscula*, but they must be completed in the order in which they are listed and you must receive a satisfactory grade from me before trying the next one. Further details of these assignments can be found [here](https://dominicmachado.github.io/opuscula-clas199-f22).
