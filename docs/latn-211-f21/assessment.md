## Mastery Quizzes - 200 points
&nbsp;  
We will have two mastery quizzes (100 points each) on verbs and nouns - that will test you comprehensively on your knowledge of fundamental building blocks of the Latin language.

Because the knowledge tested on these quizzes is essential to the course, they will be graded on a pass-fail basis, with a 95% or higher necessary for a pass. If you do not pass the quiz on your first try, you will be able to retake the quiz up to three times. In order to schedule a retake, you must email at least a week prior to when you hope to redo the quiz.

## Grammar Study Guide - 100 points
&nbsp;  
In order to help you gain a solid working knowledge of Latin syntax, you will create a grammar study guide that fits on one double-sided sheet of paper. This document will be your attempt to create your own mental map of how Latin grammar works, based on what we have learned in class. The hope is that not only will it help you to organize your own understanding of Latin grammar, but that it will function as a handy reference tool while reading Latin.

The study guide will be graded on a pass-fail basis and you will be able to revise your study guide as many as you would like in order to earn a pass.

## Passage Analysis - 200 points
&nbsp;  
Instead of more traditional assessments, you will have a series of four take-home assignments. Two of these will be passage analyses (100 points possible). These assignments will ask you to analyze a Latin passage grammatically and syntactically at a granular level, with a particular focus on topics discussed in class.

These passages will be made available to you via Google Docs roughly two weeks before the due date, each with a specific set of instructions. You will submit these assignments by sharing them with me as a Google Doc by 9:00 AM EST on the day designated by the syllabus.

***

## Translations - 200 points
&nbsp;  
The other two take-home assessments will be translations (100 points each) of the passages that you analyzed. You will use your analysis (and my corrections) to translate the passage. These translations will be due one week after you receive your corrected passage analyses from me and will be submitted as a Google Doc by 9:00 AM EST on that day.

***

## Final Passage Analysis and Translation - 200 points
&nbsp;  
Your final project will be a slightly longer of version of the take-home assignments that you have done. You will start by doing a close analysis of a passage (100 points) and then write a translation based on your analysis (100 points).

These passages will be made available to you via Google Docs on December 4. You will submit your final assignment to me as a Google Doc by 11:59 PM EST on December 18.
