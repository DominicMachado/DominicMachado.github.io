## Grammar Handouts
&nbsp;

Below you will find links to all the grammar handouts that you will be completing for homework in the first part of the semester. These handouts will contain readings and videos for you to review before coming to class. They will also feature several sentences from the Nepos' Life of Hannibal that exhibit these grammatical constructions for you to translate prior to our meetings.
